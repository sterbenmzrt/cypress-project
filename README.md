Portofolio Automation Testing using Cypress 

I'm using naveenautomationlabs.com/opencart/ for testing website testing

In this project mostly im using xpath for the locator object, i think its more spesific locator object.

This is my first time using cypress, i think this tools is cool, you can modify my project and develop it to more complex
